# Algorithmically Distinguishing Political vs. Non-Political Articles

TDM Studio provides access to U.S. Newsstream: a large database of digitized news articles written for U.S.-based publications. For this study on the portrayal of female politicians in the American media, we were interested solely in the *political* articles in this databaseâ€”particularly those concerning elections. In order to filter out the political articles from U.S. Newsstream, we used the following keywords:

```
election OR elections OR candidate OR primaries OR gubernatorial or incumbent 
```

While this filtering process does indeed eliminate many of the non-political articles in the database, it does not perfectly guarantee that our corpus 

`classifier.ipynb` contains the code that trains, hypertunes, and evaluates a classifier that can effectively distinguish between political and non-political news articles.
